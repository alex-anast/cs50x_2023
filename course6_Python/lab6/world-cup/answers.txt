Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The first doesn´t even print all the countries because the loops are so few that some of them have 0% of becoming winners. From N = 100, Brazil and Belgium already come out on top, so the result is already good.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Since the program reaches the correct predictions at N = 10000 in 0.4s, I would set the N at 20000 in order to assure correct predictions and leave some space beneath the 1s mark. Of course, that doesn´t take into account any added delay that would make the real execution time go above 1s.
