# Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters

FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glen’s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:
 
 ```lang-markdown
 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
```

Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at [figlet.org/examples.html](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html)

## Specification

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

In a file called figlet.py, a program is implemented that:

- Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
- Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
- Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
- Prompts the user for a str of text.
- Outputs that text in the desired font.
- If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

## Learning Goals

- learn how to manipulate user input from the CLI
- string manupulation
- use of sys module
